# High-Performance LRU Cache System: System Design Document

## High-Level System Design Diagram

![LRUCache System Design Diagram](<system_design.png>)

## 1. Overview

The LRU Cache system is a production-grade, thread-safe caching solution for Python applications. It provides O(1) get/set operations, TTL-based expiration, batch operations, event hooks, metrics, and health monitoring. The design is modular, extensible, and optimized for high performance and reliability in backend systems.

## 2. Architecture & Components

- **LRUCache API**: Main interface for cache operations (set, get, delete, batch, etc.).
- **Core Data Structure**: Uses `OrderedDict` for O(1) LRU eviction and fast access.
- **TTL Management & Expiry**: Each entry can have a TTL; background thread cleans up expired items.
- **Metrics & Health**: Tracks hits, misses, evictions, expirations, and exposes health status.
- **Event Hooks**: Extensible hooks for cache events (hit, miss, set, evict, expire, etc.), supporting custom monitoring/logging.
- **Batch Operations**: Context manager for efficient bulk set/get operations.
- **Serialization**: Supports JSON-based persistence and restoration.
- **Thread Safety**: All operations are protected by reentrant locks for concurrency.

## 3. Data Flow

1. **Client/Caller** interacts with the LRUCache API.
2. **API** routes requests to the core data structure and relevant subsystems (TTL, metrics, hooks).
3. **Core Data Structure** manages cache entries and LRU order.
4. **TTL Management** checks and expires entries as needed.
5. **Metrics** are updated on every operation.
6. **Event Hooks** are triggered for observability.
7. **Batch Operations** optimize bulk requests.
8. **Serialization** enables persistence if required.

## 4. Key Algorithms & Patterns

- **LRU Eviction**: Uses `OrderedDict.move_to_end()` and pop for O(1) eviction of least recently used items.
- **TTL Expiry**: Each entry stores creation time and TTL; expired entries are removed by a background thread.
- **Thread Safety**: All public methods acquire a reentrant lock to prevent race conditions.
- **Batch Operations**: Context manager acquires lock for the duration of the batch.
- **Event Hooks**: Observer pattern for cache events, allowing custom logic.

## 5. Extensibility & Customization

- **Custom Hooks**: Users can subclass `CacheHook` to implement custom monitoring, logging, or metrics.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Max size, default TTL, memory limit, metrics, cleanup interval, etc.
- **Decorator**: `lru_cache` decorator for automatic function result caching.

## 6. Reliability & Fault Tolerance

- **Background Cleanup**: Daemon thread ensures expired entries are removed even if not accessed.
- **Health Checks**: Exposes health status and metrics for monitoring.
- **Graceful Degradation**: If hooks or metrics fail, cache operations continue.

## 7. Security Considerations

- **Thread Safety**: Prevents data races and corruption.
- **Serialization**: Only serializes/deserializes safe, non-executable data.

## 8. Performance Considerations

- **O(1) Operations**: All core cache operations are constant time.
- **Batch Operations**: Reduce lock contention and improve throughput for bulk requests.
- **Metrics**: Enable performance monitoring and tuning.

## 9. Deployment & Integration

- **Installation**: `pip install .` (Python 3.7+)
- **Integration**: Import and use `LRUCache` in any Python backend or service.
- **Testing**: Modular unit, integration, and performance tests provided.
