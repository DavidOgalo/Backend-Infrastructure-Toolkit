# High-Performance LRU Cache System: System Design Document

## 1. Introduction

The High-Performance LRU Cache System is a production-grade, thread-safe caching solution engineered for Python-based backend applications. It leverages a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy with O(1) time complexity for core operations, incorporates Time-To-Live (TTL) expiration, supports batch operations, extensible event hooks, detailed metrics, and health monitoring. This design prioritizes modularity, scalability, and reliability, making it suitable for high-throughput environments such as API services, database caching, and session management.

This document outlines the system’s architecture, data flow, algorithms, extensibility, reliability, security, performance considerations, deployment strategies, and future enhancements, providing a comprehensive blueprint for implementation and maintenance.

## 2. System Overview

The LRU Cache System serves as an in-memory caching layer to optimize data access latency and reduce computational overhead in backend systems. It is designed to handle diverse use cases, including caching API responses, database query results, user sessions, and computationally expensive results. The system is built with a focus on performance, concurrency, and observability, ensuring it meets the demands of modern distributed applications.

**Key Objectives:**

- Achieve O(1) complexity for get/set operations using an efficient data structure.
- Provide TTL-based expiration with automated cleanup.
- Ensure thread safety for concurrent access in multi-threaded environments.
- Enable extensibility through customizable hooks and configuration.
- Offer robust monitoring via metrics and health checks.
- Support persistence for state recovery via serialization.

## 3. Architecture

The system is structured as a collection of modular components that collaborate to deliver a high-performance caching solution.

### 3.2 Components

- **LRUCache API**: The public interface providing methods such as `set`, `get`, `delete`, `set_many`, `get_many`, `batch_operations`, and dictionary-like access (`__getitem__`, `__setitem__`).
- **Core Data Structure**: Utilizes `collections.OrderedDict` for O(1) LRU eviction and fast key-value operations, maintaining access order.
- **TTL Management**: Manages entry expiration with a configurable TTL per entry or a default value, supported by a background daemon thread for cleanup.
- **Metrics & Health**: Tracks detailed statistics (hits, misses, evictions, expirations, memory usage) and provides health status via `health_check`.
- **Event Hooks**: Implements an observer pattern with `CacheHook` subclasses (e.g., `LoggingHook`) to handle events like hits, misses, and evictions.
- **Batch Operations**: A context manager (`batch_operations`) optimizes bulk operations by minimizing lock contention.
- **Serialization**: Enables JSON-based persistence and restoration of cache state, ensuring data integrity.
- **Thread Safety**: Employs `threading.RLock` for reentrant locking, ensuring safe concurrent access.
- **Memory Management**: Monitors and enforces size and memory limits (`max_size`, `max_memory_mb`) to prevent resource exhaustion.

## 4. Data Flow

1. **Client Interaction**: Clients invoke the `LRUCache` API with operations like `set`, `get`, or `batch_operations`.
2. **API Processing**: The API validates inputs, acquires the `RLock`, and delegates to the core data structure or subsystems.
3. **Core Operations**: The `OrderedDict` stores and manages entries, updating LRU order with `move_to_end` and removing items with `pop` when limits are exceeded.
4. **TTL Management**: The background thread periodically calls `_cleanup_expired` to remove expired entries based on `creation_time` and `ttl`.
5. **Metrics Update**: Metrics are updated atomically within locked sections (e.g., incrementing `hits` or `misses`).
6. **Event Hooks**: Hooks are triggered for relevant events (e.g., `on_hit`, `on_evict`) with error handling to ensure resilience.
7. **Batch Operations**: The `batch_operations` context manager groups multiple operations under a single lock for efficiency.
8. **Serialization**: The `serialize` method converts the cache to JSON, excluding expired entries, while `deserialize` restores valid entries.

## 5. Key Algorithms and Design Patterns

### 5.1 LRU Eviction

- **Algorithm**: Uses `OrderedDict.move_to_end()` to update access order and `popitem(last=False)` to remove the least recently used item when `max_size` is exceeded.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for get and set operations.
- **Implementation**: Leverages Python’s `OrderedDict` for efficient LRU tracking.

### 5.2 TTL Expiry

- **Algorithm**: Each `CacheEntry` tracks `creation_time` and `ttl`. A daemon thread runs every `cleanup_interval` seconds, checking `is_expired` to remove expired entries.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for cleanup (where n is cache size), performed asynchronously.
- **Implementation**: Uses `threading.Thread` with a `threading.Event` to control the cleanup loop.

### 5.3 Thread Safety

- **Pattern**: Reentrant locking with `threading.RLock`.
- **Implementation**: All public methods acquire the lock to prevent race conditions, ensuring consistency in multi-threaded scenarios.

### 5.4 Batch Operations

- **Pattern**: Context manager pattern.
- **Implementation**: The `batch_operations` context manager acquires the lock once for multiple operations, reducing overhead.

### 5.5 Event Hooks

- **Pattern**: Observer pattern.
- **Implementation**: The `CacheHook` base class defines virtual methods (e.g., `on_hit`, `on_evict`) that subclasses like `LoggingHook` can override.

### 5.6 Function Decorator

- **Pattern**: Decorator pattern.
- **Implementation**: The `lru_cache` decorator creates an `LRUCache` instance to cache function results, generating a key from `args` and `kwargs`.

### 5.7 Memory Size Estimation

- **Algorithm**: Uses `pickle.dumps` to approximate object size, falling back to `str(obj)` length if serialization fails.
- **Implementation**: Integrated into `CacheEntry.size` and monitored via `metrics.total_size`.

## 6. Extensibility and Customization

- **Custom Hooks**: Users can subclass `CacheHook` to implement custom logic (e.g., sending metrics to an external system).
- **Configurable Parameters**:
  - `max_size`: Maximum number of entries (default: 1000).
  - `default_ttl`: Default TTL in seconds (default: None).
  - `enable_metrics`: Toggle metrics collection (default: True).
  - `cleanup_interval`: Cleanup frequency in seconds (default: 60.0).
  - `max_memory_mb`: Maximum memory usage in MB (default: None).
- **Function Decorator**: The `lru_cache` decorator supports caching function results with configurable `maxsize` and `ttl`.
- **Serialization**: Supports JSON-based state persistence and restoration, excluding expired entries.

## 7. Reliability and Fault Tolerance

- **Background Cleanup**: A daemon thread ensures expired entries are removed without impacting main operations.
- **Health Checks**: The `health_check` method reports status, size, memory usage, and cleanup thread health.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Hook and metric failures are logged but do not disrupt core functionality.
- **Error Handling**: Exceptions during cleanup, hooks, or serialization are caught and logged, ensuring operational continuity.

## 8. Security Considerations

- **Thread Safety**: `threading.RLock` prevents data races and ensures consistent state.
- **Serialization Security**: Uses JSON to serialize only safe data, avoiding executable content.
- **Memory Limits**: Enforces `max_memory_mb` to prevent denial-of-service via memory exhaustion.

## 9. Performance Considerations

- **O(1) Operations**: Core operations leverage `OrderedDict` for constant-time performance.
- **Batch Operations**: Reduce lock contention, improving throughput for bulk requests.
- **Metrics Overhead**: Lightweight and optional (`enable_metrics=False` for max performance).
- **Memory Efficiency**: `max_size` and `max_memory_mb` control resource usage.
- **Background Cleanup**: Asynchronous expiration avoids runtime performance hits.

### 9.1 Performance Metrics

- Tracks `hits`, `misses`, `evictions`, `expirations`, `total_size`, `peak_size`, and derived `hit_rate`.
- Accessible via `get_metrics()` for monitoring and optimization.

## 10. Deployment and Integration
